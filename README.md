# About multiFrame

How things are going regarding a Java application based on macOS Apps. Licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/eternalbits/multiFrame/blob/main/LICENSE).

The application is done by taking as the basis the work developed by [Tobias Fischer](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub).

The icone was created by [Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/calendar_831265).

CompactVD is another project I created in repositories. You have several folders in Java configuration and the en, fr, and pt-PT folders in macOS Resources AppName that is used for installation.

JD-GUI is an old project. It is based on the Java 1.8 version. You have universalJavaApplicationStub on MacOS and the en, fr, and pt-PT folders under macOS Resources AppName.

MultiFrame is the current project. There are en, fr and pt-PT folders in the Java configuration as well as in Resources in macOS AppName.

| macOS | AppName | Files | CompactVD | MultiFrame | JD-GUI |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 10.12 Sierra | ✓ | ✓ | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8[+] |
| 10.13 High Sierra | ✓ | ✓ | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8[+] |
| 10.14 Mojave | ✓ | ✓ | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |
| 10.15 Catalina | ✓ | – | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |
| 11 Big Sur | – | – | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |
| 12 Monterey | – | – | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |
| 13 Ventura | – | – | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |
| 14 Sonoma | – | – | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |
| 15 Sequoia | – | – | 11+ | 1.8+ | 1.8 |

CompactVD=11+ means that this program requires Java 11 or later, while JD-GUI=1.8 means that the program requires Java 1.8 precisely. You can see which Java programs are installed on your computer using the command `ls /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`

It seems to me that existing CompactVD settings don't justify adjacent folders, at least relative to the universalJavaApplicationStub.
